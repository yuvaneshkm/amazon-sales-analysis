# Amazon Sales Report

## Overview

The "Amazon Sales Report" project is an end-to-end data analytics project completed during my internship at InnoByte Services. The project involves comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to provide insights into Amazon sales data. The dataset was provided by the company and required significant preprocessing to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Removed irrelevant columns.
   - Reformatted the date column for consistency.
   - Renamed columns and updated values for better clarity.
   - Integrated additional data from a CSV file containing pincode, state, and city information.
   - Joined the supplementary data with the original dataset to enhance the data quality and readiness for analysis.

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**
   - Imported the cleaned dataset into Power BI.
   - Created various interactive and insightful visualizations to analyze sales trends, regional performance, and other key metrics.
   - Designed an interactive report to provide a comprehensive view of the sales data.

3. **Deployment**
   - Deployed the interactive Power BI report to Microsoft Fabric for seamless access and sharing within the organization.
